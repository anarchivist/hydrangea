            <p>This series consists primarily of the born digital material from the Stephen Jay
                Gould (SJG) papers. The born digital material was stored in floppy diskettes, tapes
                and punch cards. The labels, if any, on the computer media are in many cases too
                brief to tell the contents in the diskettes. The processor has to view the contents
                of the files to decide the proper EAD component levels which the contents belong to.
                Since SJG divided his works into "Articles", "Abstracts, Reviews, Letters, etc.",
                "Natural History Column", and "Books" in his bibliography, the processor followed
                this arrangement and added "Bibliography &amp; CV", "Teaching", "Rare Books", "Punch
                Cards", "Misc.", and "Computer Media Photos" as other subseries. Details of the ten
                subseries are as follows.</p>
            <p>Subseries I, Articles, is divided into 15 sub-subseries according to the publication
                years: : 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998,
                1999, 2001, "Unidentified Period". Articles which the years of publication cannot be
                identified were put in "Unidentified Period". There are 99 files in this
                subseries.</p>
            <p>Subseries II, Abstracts, Reviews, Letters, etc., is divided into 6 sub-subseries
                according to the publication years: 1992, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, "Unidentified
                Period". Articles which the years of publication cannot be identified were put in
                "Unidentified Period". There are 107 files in this subseries.</p>
            <p>Subseries III, Natural History Column, is divided into 12 sub-subseries according to
                the publication years: 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999,

            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>When five-year-old Stephen Jay Gould first marveled at the towering Tyrannosaurus
                skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History, he decided to spend his life
                studying fossils. Although few children in Queens, New York, shared his early
                fascination for evolution, he never considered any other career but
                paleontology.</p>
            <p>Now professor at Harvard University and curator of its Museum of Comparative Zoology,
                Gould attended Antioch College, then returned to Manhattan, for graduate work in
                paleontology at Columbia University. For his doctoral thesis he investigated
                variation and evolution in an obscure Burmudian land snail, anchoring his later
                theorizing in intense scrutiny of a single group of organisms, as Darwin had done
                with Barnacles.</p>
            <p>At one point, he hoped to find correlation between variation and different ecologies
                within the creature's range, but the snails' sizes, colors and shell shapes seemed
                to vary quite independently of local environment. Impressed with the importance of
                nonselectionist factors in evolution, he also became interested in structural
                constraints: How slight changes in one feature must alter several others within
                definite limitsâ€”what Darwin had called "correlation of parts."</p>
            <p>Gould also became interested in distinguishing incidental features from adaptive
                ones. He coauthored (with Richard Lewontin) an influential paper inspired by the
                spandrels of certain medieval cathedrals: Geometric architectural features decorated
                with impressive religious paintings. While art historians had analyzed their
                distinctive aesthetic, most had forgotten the spandrel's humble origin as an
                unavoidable engineering consequences of stress distributionâ€”a structural byproduct
                of constructing that kind of dome. As a biological example, Gould points out that
                the human chin, often cited as "advanced" in comparisons with "lower" primates,
                holds no special correlation with higher intelligence. It is, like the spandrels, an
                incidental result of stress and growth factors in the human jawbone.</p>
            <p>Although Gould has become closely identified with the influential idea of punctuated
                equilibrium, it actually originated with paleontologist Niles Eldredge and was
                developed by them jointly. Eldredge's detailed studies of trilobites brought home to
                him a pattern that had impressed Thomas Henry Huxley: The fossil record seems to
                show "bursts" of speciation, then long periods of stability. Darwin's reply was that
                the fossil record was then too sketchy and incompletely known to provide evidence of
                pattered rates. But vast accumulations of paleontological evidence over the last
                century do not support Darwin's case for a steady, gradual evolutionary rate.
                Eldredge's trilobite series suggested, instead, relatively short episodes of rapid
                evolution followed by long periods of stability, confirming Huxley's impression.
                Gould enthusiastically agreed; it was time to acknowledge that such episodic
                patterns in the rocks probably reflect the reality of life's history. By the 1980s,
                "Punctuationalism" had become widely adopted and was proving to be a fruitful
                hypothesis for generating new insights and research. Although one of Gould's
                lifelong heroes is Charles Darwin, whose achievements he has celebrated in such
                books as Ever Since Darwin (1977) and The Panda's Thumb (1980), he is irreverent
                toward the orthodox Synthetic Theory of evolution that has prevailed in biology
                since the 1940s. Dissatisfied with the limits of its explanatory power, he is open
                to exploring other possible mechanisms and approaches to supplement traditional
                natural selectionâ€”to the dismay of more conservative colleagues.</p>
            <p>One of his approaches has been to emphasize the hierarchy of levels on which
                evolution operates; biochemical, genetic, embryological, physiological, individual,
                societal, species, lineages. Sorting or selection on any of these levels, he
                believes, produces significant effects on the level above or below itâ€”a promising
                and largely unexplored area for future research. Yale paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba
                and others agree with Gould about the importance of such hierarchical studies.</p>
            <p>Among opponents of punctuationalism, a few (Richard Dawkins, Verne Grant) complain
                Gould has set up a "straw man" of Darwinian gradualism and that jumpy or "quantum
                evolution" was discussed years ago by Ernst Mayr and George Gaylord Simpson.
                Examples of Darwin's self-contradictory fudging are easy to find, but Gould
                maintains that change "by slow, insensible degrees" remained central to Darwinian
                thought. And while acknowledging his predecessors' insights, Gould argues that often
                it is a shift of emphasis and focus rather than a radically new idea that leads to
                deeper scientific understanding.</p>
            <p>Gould's success as a popular author is another tempting target for critics; he does
                not shrink from public controversies. He appeared before Congressional committees on
                environmental issues, was a courtroom witness in the Arkansas Scopes II trial
                regarding teaching of evolution in the public schools and is prominent in speaking
                out against pseudo-scientific racism and biological determinism. But even one of his
                most adamant detractors, Robert Wright, while recently attacking one of his books in
                the pages of The New Republic, grudgingly began his diatribe: "The acclaim for
                Stephen Jay Gould is just shy of being universal . . . He is, after all, America's
                evolutionist laureate."</p>
